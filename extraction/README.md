## extraction

Bash script which will extract files from a project. The project used here is [compilation](https://github.com/MRLintern/Bash-Hacks/tree/main/compilation).
The `ZIP` folder contains:

- `main.cpp`.
- `add.h`.

The bash script is called: `extraction.sh`.

Name of `.zip` file is: `FileExtraction.zip`.

The script will perform the extraction and compile the C++ source code to produce the executable. The source files will be placed in the `src` directory
and the executable in the `bin` directory.

### Outline

- Part 1: Extract files using the `extract.sh` script.
- Part 2: Extract the files, compile the source files into an executable and move the source files to the `src` directory and the executable to the `bin` directory.

### Requirenents

- `Ubuntu`. I've tested the script on `20.04`.

### Running the Application and Sample Output


### Further Development

Consider making this an automated procedure for installing software.
