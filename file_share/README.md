## File Share

I work on multiple projects simultaneously and all these projects require a `README.md`.
To stop making multiple `README.md` files, I came up with the idea of writing a script
which would create `README.md` files and place them in specified project directories.

### TODO

This script is very basic and limited so the `README.md` files will only contain 
a basic title. The __TODO__: develop the script which when executed, creates the project
directory, places a `README.md` file inside and creates `src` and `bin` folders for
source and executable code respectively.
