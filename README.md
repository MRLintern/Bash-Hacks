## Bash Hacks

### Introduction

Bash Hacks is a repository of Bash scripts which perform all manner of tasks.
Some of these can be done using traditional methods and languages (e.g. `Python`) and don't really need `Bash scripts`.
However, I love `Linux` and automation so here we are. 

### Requirements

- `Ubuntu`. I use `20.04`.
 
### Hacks

- `compilation`: Bash script to automate the process of compiling `C++` files with some file management.
- `extraction`: Bash script used to extract files from a `ZIP` folder. Second part of the project looks at automating the extraction and compiling the source code into an executable and moving files into appropriate directories.
