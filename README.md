## Bash Hacks

### Introduction

Bash Hacks is a repository of Bash scripts which perform all manner of tasks.
Some of these tasks can be done using languages (e.g. `Python`, `Perl`etc) and don't really need `Bash scripts`
Python can at times be easier to use (I hear).
However, I love `Linux` and automation so here we are. 

### Requirements

- The list of requiremenets will grow depending on the projects I develop.

- `Ubuntu`. I use `20.04`.
- `Compiler (e.g. g++/gcc 13.1.1)`. Required for the `compilation` project.`C/C++` based projects
 
### Hacks

- `compilation`: Bash script to automate the process of compiling `C++` files with some file management.
- `extraction`: Bash script used to extract files from a `ZIP` folder. Second part of the project looks at automating the extraction and compiling the source code into an executable and moving files into appropriate directories.
- `upper_to_lower_conversion`. A script which reads a text file with uppercase words/letters and converts it to a file of lowercase words/letters.
