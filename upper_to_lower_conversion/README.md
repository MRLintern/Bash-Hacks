## Script to Convert Uppercase to Lowercase Letters

As the title says, you provide a text file full of words/letters that are all uppercase and produces a new file with lowercase words/letters. 

### Sample run

- `$ chmod +x convert.sh`
- `$ ./convert upper_case.txt`
-  `Converted file saved as 'upper_lowercase.txt'
- Output:
-       bash hacks is a repository of bash scripts which perform all manner of tasks.
        some of these can be done using traditional methods and languages (e.g. python) 
        and don't really need a bash script. however, i love linux and automation so here we are.
